5. **Support**: Access to FAQ and support information

## Administration

Administrators can access the Django admin panel at `/admin` to:
- Review submitted applications
- Change application status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- Manage user accounts
- Access uploaded documents

## Customization

The portal can be customized in several ways:
- Modify the `settings.py` file to change configuration
- Update templates in the `templates` directory
- Add or modify CSS in `static/css/style.css`
- Extend functionality by adding new views and forms

## Security Considerations

- The project uses Django's built-in security features including CSRF protection
- File uploads are validated for type and size
- Authentication is required for sensitive operations
- Production deployment should include proper security measures:
  - Change `DEBUG` to `False`
  - Set a secure `SECRET_KEY`
  - Configure HTTPS
  - Use a production-grade database
